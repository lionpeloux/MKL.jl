# Benchmark B1

This benchmark compares the absolute or relative CPU performances of several basic arithmetic functions on `n-dim`vectors :
- compare CPU time for different values of `n` (from 1e1 to 1e6) and different packages (BLAS, MKL, Native Julia)
- compare relative performance usage regarding the precision (Float32 vs. Float64)
